Description of custom sorting algorithm : This algorithm switches between quicksort, merger sort, and insertion sort. Just wanted to combine algorithms like the example in the mini-project page. 
---------------------------------------

Notes on using Copilot (or other AI) I used chat gpt. I started by asking what algorithms would work the best together and then it gave me a program. I then opened another program and I asked it if it could do better using the same sorting methods the previous one used. Then I did this one more time to see if it could improve even more. If I am honest, I am not sure I understand what it gave me. It seems very complex but I a m not sure if its correct.
